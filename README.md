# Multi Layer Perceptron - Neural Network
A Multi Layer Perceptron created to calculate XOR (eXclusive OR) on 5 inputs.
## Definitions
 - Bad facts are those where the actual output calculated by the neural netowrk is different from the expected output.
 - Good facts - negation of bad facts i.e. actual = expected

## File Structure:
- [5XOR.csv](https://github.com/LucaGatt22/MLP-neural-network/blob/main/5XOR.csv) - the XOR entries/rows/combinations for 5 inputs with their outputs
- `assign neural network.py` is the only program.
- `BadFactsVsEpochResults.csv` is an example of the results exported to a spreadsheet.
- The rest are many graphs which are images.
  - Graph data is affected by how the program is written, for example if the order of XOR entries is randomised. In fact, there are 2 folders, one named [graphs before randomising trainingSet](https://github.com/LucaGatt22/MLP-neural-network/tree/main/graphs%20before%20randomising%20trainingSet) and [graphs](https://github.com/LucaGatt22/MLP-neural-network/tree/main/graphs).
